# slideMenu

## simple slide menu  
source is ```slideMenu/```  
example is ```slideMenuTest/``` 

try and do it , and please feedback to me , if you have any suggestion , thx.

## feature
It can request "slide action" in anywhere.  
Disadvantage is only one slide menu can be build, but i think not much user need to build two slide or more than one.
