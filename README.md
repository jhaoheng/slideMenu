# slideMenu

## simple slide menu  
source is ```slideMenu/```  
example is ```slideMenuTest/``` 

try and do it , and please feedback to me , if you have any suggestion , thx.

## feature
It can request "slide action" in anywhere.  
Disadvantage is only one slide menu can be build, but i think not much user need to build two slide or more than one.

Just like you can build it on tabbar and call it on navi btn  
The maskview could let tabbar item unselect.

tabBar[build slide] -> navigation bar[do slide action]

and slide will pass delegate to tabBar
